NOTES: 


No inject.bin file becaususe the payload "NameSwitchNonsense" file needs modfied to specify what youd like the computer to be named.

change 'YouveBeenHacked' to whatever youd like the computer to be named.
(15 character limit)

then compress the file to get a inject.bin file to use on your ducky. 

*(the Inject.bin file present in the payload changes the computer name to youvebeenhacked)
